# framepunishv2

My attempt to create an application to view frame data and calculate punishes on blocked moves for Ultra Street Fighter 4.

Also using as a tool to learn C# and Windows Form.

TO DO LIST:
* Add remaining characters.
* Change any unusual frame data numbers from current characters
* Fix output of frame data to look cleaner
* Improve UI and aesthetics
